kable_as_image(kable_input, filename = NULL, file_format = "png",
  latex_header_includes = NULL, keep_pdf = FALSE, density = 300,
  keep_tex = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{kable_input}{Raw LaTeX code to generate a table. It doesn't have to
came from \code{kable} or \code{kableExtra}.}

\item{filename}{Character String. If specified, the image will be saved under
the specified (path &) name. You don't need to put file format like ".png"
here.}

\item{file_format}{Character String to specify image format, such as \code{png},
\code{jpeg}, \code{gif}, \code{tiff}, etc. Default is \code{png}.}

\item{latex_header_includes}{A character vector of extra LaTeX header stuff.
Each element is a row. You can have things like
\code{c("\\\\usepackage{threeparttable}", "\\\\usepackage{icons}")}  You could
probably add your language package here if you use non-English text in your
table, such as \code{\\\\usepackage[magyar]{babel}}.}

\item{keep_pdf}{A T/F option to control if the mid-way standalone pdf should
be kept. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{density}{Resolution to read the PDF file. Default value is 300, which
should be sufficient in most cases.}

\item{keep_tex}{A T/F option to control if the latex file that is initially created
should be kept. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
