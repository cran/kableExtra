\usage{
save_kable(x, file, bs_theme = "simplex", self_contained = TRUE,
  extra_dependencies = NULL, ..., latex_header_includes = NULL,
  keep_tex = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A piece of HTML code for tables, usually generated by kable and
kableExtra}

\item{file}{save to files. If the input table is in HTML and the output file
ends with \code{.png}, \code{.pdf} and \code{.jpeg}, \code{webshot} will be used to do the
conversion.}

\item{bs_theme}{Which Bootstrap theme to use}

\item{self_contained}{Will the files be self-contained?}

\item{extra_dependencies}{Additional HTML dependencies. For example,
\code{list(}}

\item{...}{Additional variables being passed to \code{webshot::webshot}. This
is for HTML only.}

\item{latex_header_includes}{A character vector of extra LaTeX header stuff.
Each element is a row. You can have things like
\code{c("\\\\usepackage{threeparttable}", "\\\\usepackage{icons}")}  You could
probably add your language package here if you use non-English text in your
table, such as \code{\\\\usepackage[magyar]{babel}}.}

\item{keep_tex}{A T/F option to control if the latex file that is initially created
should be kept. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
