#' @description When we are talking about table generators in R,
#' [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)'s `kable()` function wins lots of flavor
#' by its ultimate simplicity. Unlike those powerful table rendering engines
#' such as [`xtable`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xtable), the philosophy
#' behind [`knitr::kable()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/knitr/man/kable.html) is to
#' make it easy for programmers to use. Just as it claimed in its
#' function description, "this is a very simple table generator. It is simple
#' by design. It is not intended to replace any other R packages for making
#' tables. - Yihui".
#'
#' However, the ultimate simplicity of `kable()` also brought troubles to some
#' of us, especially for new R users, who may not have a lot of experience on
#' generating tables in R. It is not rare to see people including experienced
#' users asking questions like how to center/left-align a table on Stack
#' Overflow. Also, for me personally, I found myself repeatedly parsing CSS
#' into `kable()` for some very simple features like striped lines. For LaTeX,
#' it's even worse since I'm almost Stack Overflow dependent for LaTeX...
#' That's why this package `kableExtra` was created.
#'
#' I hope with `kableExtra`, you can
#' - Use default base `kable()` (Or a good alternative for markdown tables is
#' `pander::pander()`) for all simple tables
#' - Use `kable()` with `kableExtra` to generate 90 % of complex/advanced
#' tables in either HTML or LaTeX
#' - Only have to mess with raw HTML/LaTeX in the last 10% cases where
#' `kableExtra` cannot solve the problem

#' @section Features:
#' **Pipable syntax:** `kableExtra` is NOT a table generating package. It is a
#' package that can "add features" to a `kable` output using a syntax
#' that every useR loves - the [pipe](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html).
#' We see similar approaches to deal with plots in packages like `ggvis` and
#' `plotly`. There is no reason why we cannot use it with tables.
#'
#' **Unified functions for both HTML and PDF:** Most functionalities in
#' `kableExtra` can work in both HTML and PDF. In fact, as long as you
#' specifies format in `kable` (which can be set globally through option
#' `knitr.table.format`), functions in this package will pick the right way
#' to manipulate the table be themselves. As a result, if users want to left
#' align the table, `kable_styling(kable(...), position = "left")` will work
#' in both HTML and PDF.
#'
#' @note If you found a feature on the documentation site that is not available
#' in the version of `kableExtra` you are using, try to install the pre-release
#' version from github. You can do so by running
#' `devtools::install_github("haozhu233/kableExtra")`.
#'
#' Also, note that This package can load required LaTeX package automatically in
#' vanilla rmarkdown. For customized rmarkdown templates, it is recommended to
#' load related LaTeX packages manually.
